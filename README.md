Forking Excuse
==============

The only reason I forked this was so that I could limit the color list to those that I like. That's all. Flazz obviously did the hard work of writing the harvesting routine. I am merely leaching off of his hard work and the hard work of the scheme creators.

When I toggle colors, I don't want to get error messages or hurt my eyes.
